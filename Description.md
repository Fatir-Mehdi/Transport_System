realized by means of two relays mutually interlocked at the hardware level (binary outputs
QR, QS).
1 relay for creeping motion in each direction of travel (binary output QS).
1 removable workpiece carrier (pallet).
2 limit sensors (reed contacts) for the workpiece carrier (binary outputs IL, IR).
1 pulse sensor for measuring the workpiece carrier's position and/or speed
(binary input IMP).
1 SUB-D plug for connecting the transport system via a SUB-D cable to the basic
configuration.
