### Tools and Resources Used

- **PLC Programming Software**: Utilized **SIMATIC Step 7** and **CODESYS** as primary programming tools, enabling the design, implementation, and testing of control sequences in IEC 61131-compliant languages, mainly FBD (Function Block Diagram).

- **Hardware Components**:
  - **DC Motor**: Powered the conveyor belt and was controlled for speed and directional adjustments via PLC.
  - **Conveyor Belt System**: Acted as the main transport medium for workpieces, enabling automated movement and handling.
  - **Sensors**: Included limit switches, pulse sensors, and optical sensors, essential for detecting position, speed, and object characteristics.
  - **Actuators**: Used magnetic valves and stop cylinders to manage workpiece positioning and to control conveyor belt operations.

- **Programming and Control Structures**:
  - **Function Blocks (FBs)**: Created reusable modules, such as speed monitoring and flashing functions, to promote organized and efficient code.
  - **Symbol Table**: Mapped PLC addresses to symbolic names for enhanced readability and ease of modification.

- **Testing and Debugging Tools**:
  - **Variable Table (VAT)**: Employed for live monitoring and debugging, displaying real-time values of inputs, outputs, and internal variables to identify issues and optimize performance.

- **Documentation and Code Resources**:
  - **Function Plans and Code Listings**: Provided references for control logic design, allowing for comparison with standard approaches and reinforcing best practices.

These tools and resources collectively supported the development and validation of a reliable, modular control system for transport automation, enhancing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.
