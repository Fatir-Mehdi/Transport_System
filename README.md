## Methodology

The documents provide a structured, IEC 61131-based approach to designing control systems for transport automation.


System Requirements: Overview of components (DC motor, sensors, PLC) and task objectives.

Hardware Setup: Connection diagrams, I/O mappings, and symbol table usage for clarity.

Control Design: Starts with verbal plans, then develops function plans using FBD, ST, or GRAPH.

Programming: Implements functions (FCs) and function blocks (FBs) in main program (OB1).

## Tools Required:

PLC Programming Software: Primarily SIMATIC Step 7 and CODESYS, supporting IEC 61131 languages (FBD, ST, GRAPH) for designing and testing control programs.

Key Hardware Components:

DC Motor: Drives the conveyor belt, controlled via PLC for speed and direction.

Conveyor Belt: Transports workpieces, with control for precise movement.

Sensors: Include limit switches, pulse sensors, optical, inductive, capacitive, and magnetic sensors for detecting positions, objects, or materials.

Actuators: Magnetic valves and stop cylinders for controlling workpiece movement and positioning.

SUB-D Cables/Connectors: Ensures signal transmission and compatibility between PLC and hardware.

## Description

**The project covers several project which includes:**


Conveyor Belt Control Experiments: These experiments introduce practical application of PLC programming to control the conveyor belt.

Inching Mode: This experiment focuses on controlling the conveyor belt's movement in both directions using buttons. The conveyor belt moves as long as the button is pressed and stops when released.

Inching Mode with Deactivation at Limits: This builds upon inching mode, adding limit switches to stop the conveyor belt automatically at the predefined end positions.

Inching Mode with Reversal: This experiment involves programming the conveyor belt to automatically reverse direction when it reaches a limit switch, effectively making it move back and forth between the two end positions.

Position Measurement/Speed Control: This experiment utilizes the pulse sensor to accurately measure the position of the workpiece carrier on the conveyor belt. It also involves programming the PLC to control the speed of the conveyor belt based on its position, for example, moving at full speed until reaching a midpoint, then slowing down to a creep speed.

Function Blocks: Function blocks are reusable code modules that encapsulate specific functionalities.

Flashing Module: This involves creating a function block that controls a flashing lamp. This function block could be used for various purposes, like indicating a system status or an alarm condition.

Speed Monitor: This experiment focuses on designing a function block to continuously monitor the conveyor belt's speed. If the speed drops below a predefined threshold, this function block triggers an alarm, potentially indicating a fault or problem with the conveyor system
